PREFACE: 

This is a multi-language, framework based iOS application that was created with the sole intention of learning different CS concepts when it comes to web application and mobile application development. There was no intention for this application to ever go into real world use/production. This was created around the time of my first Software Engineering Internship, in which I learned a lot about React Native and React application development.

FEATURES:

1) Data management and database functionalities.
2) Security with Recaptcha
3) User phone verification and login
4) Animated user interfaces in the front-end using different API's.
5) Reusable components made from scratch.
